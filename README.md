# Industrial Combustion Energy Use Project â€“ Data-Driven Insights with MySQL, Excel & Power BI

This project presents a complete data analytics workflow designed to analyze industrial energy consumption. Leveraging 20K+ real-world records, it integrates data preprocessing in Excel, relational modeling in MySQL, and interactive visualization in Power BI.

Key Features:

Detects high-energy-consuming facilities and identifies fuel inefficiencies.

Tracks regional and industrial energy patterns (MMBtu & GWht).

Computes insightful KPIs: fuel type usage, company-specific trends, MECS region shares, and more.

Offers a Power BI dashboard for stakeholders to explore and make decisions visually.

Whether you're a data analyst, energy consultant, or simply exploring data projects, this repository showcases how raw industrial data can be turned into powerful insights for sustainable energy optimization.
